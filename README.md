# Phone-To-PC

This is a small program I am developing to control my PC (Arch Linux) from my Android phone, it currently only controls a small number of things and can only be run from my PC, therefore defeating the whole purpose of the program. However, I look to change this in the future. The code is probably very poor but I am using this as a learning experience and hope to continue to improve the program over the next few weeks and possibly longer.
